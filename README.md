# MITworkshops

This is a repository to store rercordings of as many MIT workshops as possible. This is a open repostiory to benefit anyone and everyone who wants to learn anything. The lockdown, and the new normal of online learning has provided us with the amazing opportunity to have recordings of workshops, which can be referred again and again, and by larger number of people!

If anyone wants to contribute, go ahead!
